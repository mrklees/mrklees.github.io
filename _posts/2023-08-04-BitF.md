# BitF 2023

Fresh off [Critical](/events/critical) Haus Anima loaded up another trailer and headed for Canada.

Having never been to Burn in the Forest (BitF) we did know exactly what to expect.
Getting to the event proved to be an entire adventure of its own; incredulous border agents, last minute reservations, and Ribbit's bag riding on the top of the car for an hour of our drive.
<br>
Once we got to the event and found our updated location we felt more at home. Art was going up all around us, Our neighbors stopping by and said hi, and in the distance the bass thum had already started.

After a long Wednesday almost everything was setup and we were starting to enjoy the event.

<strong>Wind! Rain! Thunder! Oh My!</strong>
Everyone huddled in our kitchen waiting out the inclement weather.

The rain dried up quickly in the Friday heat, but we found ourselves unprepared for the never-ending sun.
Eventually we fashioned some portable shade and learned to love lounging at the river.

BitF had some wonderful art. The Love Bus, a giant ballpit in a Bus, was a fun surprise.

The BIG SOUND camps were amazing! With the large venue they could be spaced so that each camp had a big dance floor letting us spin poi and enjoy the music at the volume we enjoy.
The sound camps were packed from 5pm to 5am everyday and we failed to get photos without people in them (or permission to post)

Kalesta and Ribbit hail from high desert and were familiar with the terrain and animals. It was a pleasant surprise to see locust, chipmunks, and dry grass.

In addition to new art forms we enjoyed some of our favorites: Lyra, Poi, and Prom!

There's always time to do a little extra art at the event. Ribbit added the shooting star to our Neighbor's Stardust Saloon sign.

This is our fourth event with a trailer and were getting better each time! We managed to leave before noon and avoid most of the heat!
