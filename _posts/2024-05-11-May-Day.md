## May Day

Spring üå± are blooming, the ‚òÄÔ∏è  is shining, everything feels alive and happy!

Haus Anima celebrated the changing of the season with the Fremont Art Council at Meridian Park. Sheltered in a little meadow we made flower crowns, moved our bodies, and danced around three May Poles.

Maque, FAC's long time May Pole specialist, was supposed to be in France so Seth/Z got the secret training in FAC's pneumatic May Pole system. Loren helped choose ribbons and Kalesta helped braid the May Pole ribbons.

At the event we set up a small comfy space filled with our favorite things: friends, music, poi, and shade.

First up was a 12" May Pole for the kids. With help from some FAC regulars it went off without a hitch.

Moving on to the 20" pneumatic May Poles everyone jumped in to help: Pete, Darren, Conny, Kelley, Kalesta, and Loren.
Many hands made the work light and fast.
Soon we had 48 folks dancing and weaving around the May Pole. Afterwards the ribbons were immacualtely weaved.

Seth ran a final with only 18 ribbons for FAC regulars. I enjoyed dancing with so many folks I see regurarly.
I hooked elbows, bowed, and twirled in pure bliss.
The audiance called for Seth to be tied to the May Pole as May King and another volunteered was tied up as May Queen.
