## May Day

üå∏ are blooming, the ‚òÄÔ∏è  is shining, everything feels alive and happy!

Haus Anima celebrated the changing of the season with the Fremont Art Council at Meridian Park. Sheltered in a little meadow we made flower crowns, moved our bodies, and danced around three maypoles.

Maque, FAC's long time maypole specialist, was supposed to be in France so Seth/Z got the secret training in FAC's pneumatic maypole system. Ribbit helped choose ribbons and Kalesta helped cut, attach, and crochet the ribbons so they were maypole-ready.

At the event we set up a small comfy space filled with our favorite things: friends, music, flow toys, and shade. Kalesta volunteered at the flower crown table, helping participants weave flowers into beautiful headdresses.

First up was a 12' maypole for the kids. With help from some FAC regulars it went off without a hitch.

Moving on to the 20" pneumatic maypoles everyone jumped in to help. Many hands made the work light and fast and soon we had 48 folks dancing and weaving around the maypole.

We ran a final maypole with 18 ribbons for FAC regulars. It was fun to dance with so many FAC folks: to hook elbows, bow, and twirl the afternoon away.
