## SeaCompression Year Two

Haus Anima's second Seacompression. This year we went into the event excited about our plan for amazing interactive art, a well curated layout, and the warmer weather forecast.

<p markdown="span">
  We created four new art pieces for the event: **Dance with Death**, **Cabinet of Curious Creations**, **Ears of the Future**, and **Sound-Toy**.
  <br>
  Two existing art pieces, **Mourning Owl** (from 2022 Seacompression) and **Dream Willow** were enhanced.
  <br>
  Kalesta and Skipper were leads in Art Grants and Art Vis respectively. Both of them helped fill the event with art.
</p>

## New Art - Dance with Death, Ears of the Future, Curio Cabinet, Sound Toy

## Projection Mapping! Fiber Optics!

<p markdown="span">
  **Setup Wizard**, From Wizards Camp, created an incredible projection map for the Crows on the back of **Mourning Owl**.
  <br>
  We added fiber optics to **Dream Willow's** boughs (hard to photograph with the ambient street light)

## Artistic Vision

**Skipper** was an event lead for SeaCompression Artistic Vision, working to create signage and thematic ambiance at the event. Several days before the event all of Haus Anima showed up and help paint signs that were spread all over the event.

<p class="text-center" markdown="span">
Signage for Gradus Ad Parnassum - one of the three bars.

## Cabinet of Curious Creations

Ribbit launched the idea for the Cabinet of Curious Creations. It featured three layers of oddities; the top layer was a caterpillar carousel sculpted by Ribbit, the middle layer featured fluffy clouds and sculptures created by Kalesta, and the bottom cabinet was filled with Zhigalka's nesting cabinets-- 3D printed replicas of the larger cabinet.

## Dance With Death

Death was born from Kalesta's love for giant puppets and Zhigalka's desire to do more flat-pack art at Haus Anima. With the project decided, only the details remained. The theme for SeaCompression, Macabre Magnifique, gave a clear direction: Death themself would be our puppet.

Paying homage to the Danse Macabre, Ribbit and Kalesta sclupted a 10 foot tall skeleton with a gilded crown and a sign around their neck reading "May I Have This Dance?".

</figure>
For much of the event Death adorned our frontage, inviting guests to write letters. But for about an hour Death walked around, inviting participants to dance. Kids and adults alike enjoyed answering Death's call to dance.

We can't wait to have Death dance with us again at future events.

## Ears of the Future

Hearing Protection is important. We created **Ears of The Future** to lend out children's ear muffs and gift ear plugs for anyone who forgot their hearing protection. We love getting to choose how much of the BIG sound to experience.

<figure class="thin" markdown="span">
  ![Ears of the Future at event](https://static.cloudygo.com/static/2023-Seacompression/Ears%20of%20the%20Future%20at%20event.jpg)
</figure>

We gifted out around a hundred pairs of ear plugs during the event and many people told us warm tales.
We're excited to bring this to future events.

## Sound-Toy

Lilac is experimenting with non-conventional instrument and interactive sound toys. A number of percussive tools were provided to passers-by for a participatory audio experience.
