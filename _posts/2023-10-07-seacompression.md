## SeaCompression Year Two

This is Haus Anima's second Seacompression. With Leads on Grants and Art Vis we had really good insight into the event. After showing art in 2022 we had some great ideas about how to create amazing interactive art.

[Photo album from Seacompression 2023](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DpLAoXQJJcddyNYs8)

We showed four new art pieces, Death, Cabinet of Curious Creations, Ears of The Future, and Sound-Toy. Two existing art pieces, Mourning Owl (from 2022 Seacompression) and Dream Willow were enhanced.

## New Art - Dance with Death, Ears of the Future, Curio Cabinet, Sound Toy

## Dance With Death

Death. Dance with Death.

Haus Anima brought to life Death. Animating them as a giant Puppet for any and all to dance with.

Back at camp we had a small letter writing area for folks to compose letters to Death.

## Ears of the Future

Hearing Protection is important. We created **Ears of The Future** to lend out Children's ear muffs and gift ear plugs for anyone who forgot their hearing protection. We love the big noise of the event MORE WORDS TODO.

<figure class="thin" markdown="span">
  ![Ears of the Future at event](https://static.cloudygo.com/static/2023-Seacompression/Ears%20of%20the%20Future%20at%20event.jpg)
</figure>

We gifted out around a hundred pairs of ear plugs during the event and many people told us warm tales.
We're excited to bring this to many future events.

## Sound-Toy

Lilac is making non-conventional instrument and interactive sound toys. A number of percussive tools were provided to passers-by for a participatory audio experience.
