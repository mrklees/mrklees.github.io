**Special Report!** Haus Anima PixelArt Game Collaboration! **Read all about it!**

While browsing [r/PixelArt](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/) Loren
discovered the subreddit was creating a community collaborative game project.
u/skeddles spent several months writing the code, building a website, and
cheerleading a top-down puzzle game. Various artists submitted pixel art for
several unique levels.

Loren spent a week designing a pixel art level for the project.

Lily Pad Temple features a pond with giant lily pads, a wise owl in a tree,
an orange cat who can only be appeased by bringing it a collectable fish,
dangerous fireflowers, koi ponds, and more.

Lilac was pulled in to produce some accompanying music.
**By Moon’s Light** features a tawny owl’s call and soft pond noises over a
dark ambient track inspired by the sounds of old console games.

Inspired by the soundtrack Loren spent another day immersed in Lilac’s sound,
polishing the level: improving the collectables, refining the owl, and subtly adding variance.
