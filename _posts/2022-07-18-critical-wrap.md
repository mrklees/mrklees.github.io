Haus Anima's first **Critical NW** was a blast! The four of us combined art powers to host an enormous Electroluminescent Menagerie!

Our visual artists brought 10 animal panels for collaborative coloring, 8 light up animal cutouts for frontage, and several original paintings.

[Space Sounds](https://anima.haus/music/#space-sounds), our interactive A/V project, also made an appearance with new music and interactions between the sounds and our LED light display.

The total effect created a chill, ethereal vibe that we felt provided some needed respite from the stimulation of esplanade!

To all the artists that stopped by, colored, painted, and joined our collaborative art. Thanks! We're so happy with the art we all created!

While this was not our first Burner event it was the first time we've hosted a theme camp and it was so rewarding to meet
other artists and burners. We enjoyed meeting several individuals who stopped by each day to see the menagerie unfurl
and be colored.
