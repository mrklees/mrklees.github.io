excerpt: Critical 2022

Haus Anima's first **Critical NW** was a blast! The four of us combined art powers to host an enormous Electroluminescent Menagerie!

We brought 10 collaborative animal panels, 8 light up animal cutouts, ambient forest sounds, and much more.

While this was not our first Burner event it was the first time we've hosted a theme camp and it was so rewarding to meet
other artists and burners. We were excited to meet several individuals who stopped by each day to see the menagerie unfurl
and be colored.

To all the artists that stopped by, colored, painted, and joined our collaborative art Thanks! We jointly created wonderful art.

In addition to our art we had some brilliant LED lighting thanks to Zhigalka and hand crafted cocktails by Lilac.
