We're going to [Luminata](https://fremontartscouncil.org/luminata) with an
Illuminated Betta Fish! Hope to see you there!

Luminata is hosted by the Fremont Arts Council. We adore F.A.C for their varied
public art projects and events. Keep Fremont Weird F.A.C!

Our [grant proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sflE5jwngQAe88uPlikEkiWnCMIPe8PDSkg-EC9p7mk/edit)
Includes photos and description of the project!
