In our first public event as a collective we attended Remergence 2022 and had a ton a fun!

It was a such a joy to see a great deal of fun had with our interactive art exhibit *Sounds, Lights, and Solar Systems*. Dozens of collaborators of all ages contributed to the solar system, leveraging watercolors, sharpies, and unbridled creativity.

The other half of the project, our interative sound & lights exhibit, delighted the many who came by to create cosmic ambiance.

By all measures Remergence 2022 was a great success for Haus Anima, and we're very excited to continue to refine the venture in preparation for our next event at [Critical Northwest](https://criticalnw.org/)!
