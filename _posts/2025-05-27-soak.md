# SOAK* 2025
---

This was Haus Anima's second SOAK\*. ([Report from our first SOAK\*](/art/events/2024-soak/))

SOAK* is a Burning Man Regional held in Oregon over Memorial Day weekend in a beautiful isolated valley. It's slightly debated why it's called SOAK* but this year it was probably because it rained on us.

Again we intended this to be a light burn: a smaller camp, existing art, and no new major art projects. And again we made a number of new art pieces and required 2 hauling vehicles. Whoops :shrug:

* Ribbit and Zhigalka created a new Camp Sign [***Haus Cats***](#haus-cats) with the help of Andrew, Andy, Colby and Samwise
* Skipper brought **Honk Dawg** and seeded the event with tiny squeakers *Squeak* **Squeak**
* Kalesta created **Dildidol** to be featured in a friend's camp
* Ribbit constructed four [**Monster Mirrors**](#monster-mirrors)
* Ribbit and Kalesta handpainted 60+ [tiny picture frames](#trinket-trading) for trinket trading
* Ribbit handcrafted fifty [**Eye Cult Spell bottles**](#trinket-trading) for trinket trading
* Samwise created Eye Cult porto art

In addition to visual art

* Andrew ran a "Negronis Only" bar and performance bit
* We added more Haus Anima stickers
* Zhigalka and Ribbit coordinated a May Pole
* Haus Anima hosted a fire circle where we performed several nights
* Kalesta and Skipper participated in leads exchange, shadowing Placement and Gate to better learn how SOAK runs their event

## Camp Layout

We're black and white and all our frontage, including our neighborâ€™s RV, looked on point.

Andrew and Patches provided a wonderful [solar setup](#solar) allowing us plenty of power for lights, music, and grinding coffee

## Fire Circle

At night our black lights lit up coloring pages, and fire rippled throughout our performance area.

We had a surprise appearance from DJ S Tickets who DJ'd our fire circle from opening till the beginning of quiet hours.

One of our goals in hosting a fire circle is to welcome newer fire spinner and cheer them on.
In addition to our camp members, several folks from The Meadow joined us as well as a number of our Seattle Friends.

## Haus Cats

## Solar

All the camp is excited that we ran off solar power this year!
A big thanks to Andrew and Patches would brought a solar panel and batteries.

Shout-out to Best Michael for the Seattle Autonomous Zone sticker!
A SOAK* easter egg for all the Seattle camps who found themselves placed in The Meadow.

## Haus Cat Construction

At Craft Night, Ribbit drew two cats on a sheet of plywood.
Then Ribbit, Andrew, Samwise, Colby, and Zhigalka spent a night cutting out four copies.

The second copies were cut again, removing the inside to make a frame for LEDs.

<figure class="half" markdown="span">

</figure>

The two weekends before the event Ribbit painted the one-eyed sphynx murals on the plywood.

On zero hours of notice Andy agreed to give an introduction to welding and helped Zhigalka create the legs at their shop.

</figure>

This has been a wonderful project, working with friends, making fun art, and fulfilling the camps need for a sign.

It also achieves Zhigalka's high art standards.
1. Flat pack
1. Easy to transport
1. Easy to setup
