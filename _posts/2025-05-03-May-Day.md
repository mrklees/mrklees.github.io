## May Day

May in Seattle; a sprinkle of rain (üå¶Ô∏è), some rays of sunshine (üåû), and May Day with the Arts Council!

Haus Anima celebrated with Fremont Art Council and friends at Meridian Park.
New friends, old friends, and soon to be friends juggled, spun poi, and danced around a maypole.

Seth/Z is in the second year of maypole training with Maque. With additional help from their father Jim and friends Andrew and Lambo, the maypoles went up without a hitch.

This year the ribbons were green, blue, purple, and white. Brenda, Jim, and two volunteers managed to fully unwind 30 foot ribbons from the children's maypole and 10ft sections have been saved from the second maypole. You can expect to see reclaimed ribbons on Parade floats, at Critical, and around the Powerhouse for at least a year.

The maypole dance ended with us tying our friends to the pole as May Queen and King!

Ribbit showed three of their flower faces for the first time which adorned our small respite. We had new child-sized flow props, staffs, and juggling clubs too.

If you were there, we cherished spending a classic Seattle spring day with you, in a park, in celebration!
