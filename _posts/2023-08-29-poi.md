# Poi Making
---

Moving your body is fun.

At festivals we tend to care around a large collection of flow toys; juggling clubs, ribbon poi, levy wand. At camp we curate a flow space and crate of flow toys to share with friends.

In 2023 on a whim, Seth sewed juggling props in fun patterns for everyone in the house.
The house was briefly enthralled with juggling which set the stage for what was to come.
Leading up to Critical, Loren sewed three sets of ribbon poi from reclaimed maypole ribbons.

In June, Kelley (Skipper) sought out Fire Poi at Northwest Flow Fest and brought the energy and ðŸ”¥ to our backyard.

# Making our own POI

### Ribbon Poi, Play Poi, Flag Poi, Fire Poi! So many options. So much fun!

Loren has lead two rounds of making ribbon poi (the poi has ribbons attached that stream behind them), most recently making Eye Cult-themed ribbon poi from fabric Kalesta picked out.

Over six pairs of Poi! Loren has come to prefer a 5x6 pouch with ~60 grams of poly pellets.

### Handles, Leashes, Floops

We've made several variants: Floops, Monkey fists, Beads (3/4 in).

We like nylon webbing sewed directly to fishing tackle swivels. For fire poi we use cotton webbing and quick links for a little extra strength.

### Fire Poi!

Following a few online tutorials, we folded 40" strips of kevlar and bolted it all together into cathedral poi for firespinning.

### Juggling Props - Just for fun some photos of our own juggling balls.

This was the fabric that kicked off some of this fun!

### Flag Poi - TDB

We saw some wonderful Flag Poi at BitF, and have been thinking about making our own since then.
We have a connecting with a wonderful silk artist and in the future may ask them to dye and sew us a set!



## May Day with Fremont Art Council friends!

We set up a small flow space; mostly with Juggling props and enjoyed sharing with friends and strangers a like.

Some of the ribbon from the maypole would later become part of our first ribbon poi.
