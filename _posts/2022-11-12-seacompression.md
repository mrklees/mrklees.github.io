### Another Successful Haus Anima Event!
---

We showed our new painting, **Mourning Owl**, along with
Wish Fish (previously [BettaFish](/events/luminata)), and our Jellyfish.

Lilac and Kelly developed new costumes and volunteered with the Costume Closet
(one of Haus Anima’s favorite camps to see at events).
Kalesta and Loren decided on backpack terrarium/oxygen tanks as a fun climate
apocalypse piece and tribute to the night’s theme of World’s End Faire.

After finishing Mourning Owl, Loren found time to design and paint a
“World’s End Faire” cityscape for people to draw on under blacklights at the event.
As always, it was delightful to see the ways people interacted with and added to the piece.

The construction of Mourning Owl was inspired by a flat-packed plywood LED piece Zhigalka saw at Critical in 2018.
Lilac produced a soundtrack with owl hoots, a sample from Twin Peaks “Owls are not what they seem”, along with all their usual music goodness.

Loren and Zhigalka moodboarded with MidJourney- a tool that Loren has been experimenting with in the sketch phase of their process.
Then Loren designed and painted the final painting onto the plywood.
Zhigalka started from old code and added some new patterns for the LED lights.

### Behind the Scene - Our Mourning Owl Process

It took around 5 weekends from idea to showing at Seacompression. 1 weekend to buy lumber, 1 weekend to paint everything black, 1 weekend to cut lumber and assemble the frame and stand, 1 week to paint, and 1 week for LED coding and final assembly.

We solidly achieved a good matte finish, hidden wires, and recessed diffused LEDs which give the piece a nice polished look. We built a base for free-standing display. At Seacompression we hung it from our structure so that it floated ethereally.

– Amidst the darkness of winter, taking a night for lights, dancing, and art was a welcome respite for Haus Anima. It was great to be recognized by many of the folks we’ve met at Luminata, Critical, and Remergence.
