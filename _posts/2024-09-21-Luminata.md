## Luminata

Fall means the darkening of days and the coming of rain. For Haus Anima and
[Fremont Arts Council](https://fremontartscouncil.org/luminata) it means
celebrate the September equinox with lanterns and the lighting of Greenlake!

Five years ago Z showed LED Grass at Luminata as their first granted art piece!
More recently Ribbit, Kalesta and Z created
[Illuminated Betta Fish (later WishFish)](https://anima.haus/events/luminata/)
and showed [Mourning Owl](https://anima.haus/events/2022-seacompression/)
at Luminata.

This year we choreographed a Fire Performance for the end of the lantern procession. We also made a few lanterns while helping out at Powerhouse Workshops.

We took inspiration and a good deal of advice from Maque and Norma of FAC and Cirque De Flambe about construction of flaming puppets.

We constructed a giant puppet sun from kevlar to accompany our fire performance.

A few of our Burning Man friends performed with us at the end of the lantern procession.

The Fire üî•üéá was magical, clean, and crisp: a thing that's very difficult to capture on camera.
