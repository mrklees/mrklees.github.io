We're going to [Luminata](https://fremontartscouncil.org/luminata) with an
**Interactive Illuminated Betta Fish**! Hope to see you there! (Our lovely
webmaster wants to know these posts aren't redirected to the void)

Luminata is hosted by the Fremont Arts Council. We adore F.A.C for their varied
public art projects and events. Keep Fremont Weird F.A.C!
