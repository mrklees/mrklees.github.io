Haus Anima joined [Fremont Arts Council](https://fremontartscouncil.org/petit-troll) for their 2023 Petit Troll Parade to celebrate Mardi Gras.

We met at the Powerhouse to paw through beads and goo gahs and hot glue it all together into miniature parade floats.
It great to spend time with other artists and be inspired by the three decades of FAC art on display.

Kelley and Lilac created a disco dance floor complete with froggy DJ and a speaker playing dance-worthy disco tunes.

Kalesta crafted a carnivorous plant candy box with a spider guardian, Loren made a towering castle out of recycled containers and foil, and Seth dressed an eye-catching mannequin head atop a red wagon.

We gathered with Fremont Art Council members and the Neon Brass Party band to dazzle and march our way through the Fremont Sunday Market. The celebratory atmosphere was electrifying.

Thanks to Norma and the Fremont Arts Council for hosting this event! We look forward to doing more events with FAC in the future.
