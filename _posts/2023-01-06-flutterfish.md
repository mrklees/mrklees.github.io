Haus Anima just wrapped up their “Flutterfish” display at the
[Port Angeles Fine Arts Center’s Wintertide Festival of Lights.](

Kalesta sculpted each of the five fish using polymer clay over a foil and wire armature.

Then Loren and Kalesta painted the fish with neon paints and attached their whimsical wings constructed from cellophane and wire.

They installed the five fish in Webster’s Woods at the Port Angeles Fine Arts Center.

The fish fluttered among the trees from November ‘til January, illuminated each night by UV rays.
