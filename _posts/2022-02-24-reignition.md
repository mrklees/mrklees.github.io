We're going to [Reignition](https://www.facebook.com/events/3184197958490943/) to make weird lights and sounds!

Zhigalka and I are putting together a first pass at an A/V project that will leverage VCV Rack to create the sound and animate reactive patterns on our accompanying LED project.

Hope to see you there!

Sneak Peak
----------

In *Rounds* the keyboard and knobs give control over key, tempo, reverb, and more.
