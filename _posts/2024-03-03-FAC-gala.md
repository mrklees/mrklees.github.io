## Botanical Bacchanal: A Garden of Mirthly Delights

Few things are as dear to us at Haus Anima as The [**Fremont Art council**](https://fremontartscouncil.org/).
They bring an incredible amount of free weird and wonderful community art to Seattle and we love getting to be a part of it.

We were honored to be asked to do an installation for their 2024 Gala. The theme was Botanical Bacchanal with the concept of a larger than life garden. our space would be a twenty foot square pure white room. The possibilities were endless.

Kalesta had been looking for an opportunity to do a project that incorporates colored shadows- a technique that uses single point red green and blue lights to cast shadows in 7 different shades. It is a magical effect that is perfectly suited for an installation in such a perfectly white room. We knew we needed flowers to incorporate the Garden theme and decided that Dahlias with all their points giving opportunities for shadows would be perfect.

We decided to create an immersive interactive experience where participants could dance with their shadows in a room filled with nine foot tall dahlias while listening to a magical garden soundtrack created by Lilac.

Ribbit took the helm as team lead going to planning meetings and putting together a proof of concept early in the process. Zighalka and Ribbit sorted out the technical side by finding the right lights to use. With the concept thoroughly procedure - we moved onto construction of the Dahlias.

Each flower consists of 60 to 100 sheets of paper cut into squares and then rolled into cones. The flowers ranged from 3-5 feet across and took up an incredible amount of space to make and store. We did much of this construction of our giant flowers at the Powerhouse (FAC’s workspace/studio in Fremont). Having a space to assemble these larger than life dahlias was absolutely critical to this project's success and it was delightful to watch the space fill with giant paper flowers and sculpted bugs as other artists worked on their installations for the Gala along side us.

As we neared the deadline we realized we had time to complete one of our stretch goals for the project- shadow puppet bugs for participants to play with. Zighalka laser cut several bug forms and we added cellophane to give them an extra effect. We also realized with this addition that it would be helpful to have someone docent the art- someone to encourage the stuffy gala attendees to play.

Skipper was happy to step into the role and even created a high fashion dahlia costume complete with a dahlia headdress that perfectly matched the theme of the room to wear while they docented.
