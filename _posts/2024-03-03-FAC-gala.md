## Botanical Bacchanal: A Garden of Mirthly Delights

Few things are as dear to us at Haus Anima as The [**Fremont Art council**](https://fremontartscouncil.org/).
They bring an incredible amount of free weird and wonderful community art to Seattle and we love getting to be a part of it.

We were honored to be invited to design an installation for the FAC's 2024 Gala. The theme was "Botanical Bacchanal" with the concept of a larger-than-life garden. The room we chose to design was pure white and twenty feet square: an entirely blank canvas. The possibilities were endless.

Kalesta had been looking for an opportunity to do a project that incorporated colored shadows: a theory called "trichromy" where a red, a green, and a blue light combine to cast shadows in seven different shades. It is a magical effect that is well suited for an installation in such a blank room. We knew we needed flowers to incorporate the larger-than-life garden theme and decided that dahlias, with all their points, were the perfect candidates. 

Ribbit took the helm as team lead, attending planning meetings and putting together a tiny scale proof of concept early in the process. Zighalka and Ribbit sorted out the technical side by finding the right lights to use.

With the concept thoroughly in place, we moved onto construction of the dahlias. We built each flower from 60 to 100 sheets of tagboard cut into squares and then rolled into cones.  We used hot glue to attach them to a recycled cardboard base. The flowers slid onto PVC stems, held in place with paper towel tubes. 

Each dahlia ranged from three to five feet across and took up an incredible amount of space to make and store. We did much of this construction at the Powerhouse (FAC’s workspace/studio in Fremont). Having a space to assemble these larger-than-life dahlias was absolutely critical to this project's success and it was delightful to watch the Powerhouse fill with giant paper flowers and sculpted bugs as other artists worked on their installations for the Gala alongside us.

We also created eight sections of grass and two mushrooms, cut from cardboard and whitened with a facade of paint and paper.

As we neared the deadline we realized we had time to complete one of our stretch goals for the project- shadow puppet bugs the participants could use to play and cast shadows in the room. Zighalka laser cut several bug forms and we added cellophane to give them an extra glittery effect.

We also realized with this addition that it would be helpful to have someone to docent the art and encourage the gala attendees to play. 
Skipper stepped seamlessly into the role, creating a high fashion costume complete with a dahlia headdress crafted from one of our early prototypes. Skipper also designed a makeup look to accentuate the costume.

The day of the Gala was finally here. We traveled to Sodo to set up.

Lilac created a soundtrack to accentuate the space, filling the room with tranquil garden and nature sounds.

In addition to our room, we created several other art pieces for costumes and for other artist's rooms.
