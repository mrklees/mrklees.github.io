## 2024 Fire Horse

At several Fire jams all the fire props end up scattered about on the ground.
It's hard to find yours, your stepping on people's props, and it's easy to trip.

So Z created this "Fire [Saw] Horse" on a CNC.
It collapses and goes to all the fire events with us.
It holds around a half dozen staffs and poi at the same time.
V2 is constantly in the work but really is coming soon.

## 2023 Fire Cathedrals

Loren and Z made these as our first fire props in Oct 2023. One thing we learned was to put the washers one layer inside so you can touch your props more!

## 2023 POI

Loren made half a dozen sets of ribbon poi after 2023 May Day. Several are black and white with eyes for the Haus, Some are ribbon poi with reclaimed May Day ribbons. The green pair Z made and are EXTRA SUPER long.
