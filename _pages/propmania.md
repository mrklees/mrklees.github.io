## 2025 Juggling Poi

An in-progress Z adventure post-SOAK. Thanks to Andrew for the retired climbing rope for leashes.

## 2025 Sun Wheel

Just slightly before SOAK* AKA in the car on the way down. Z made this Sun Wheel. Ribbit helped glueing the pex tube and spraypainting.

<figure class="thin" markdown="span">

Z accidentally cut the first ropes at half length. So this ended up being a prototype of the knots.

## 2025 Glowstick Poi

Lilac has occasionally had difficulty in taking their props, especially levy wands, into venues. In response she constructed these cute glowstick poi.

## 2025 Silicon Poi Handles

Z got excited about custom silicone molds in 2025 and did a number of projects (crystals, collars, handles) designing models, 3d printing molds, and pouring silicone.

<figure class="half" markdown="span">

</figure>

Z has printed named molds for many of our flow friends. Samwise mixed this color and we did a joint pour :heart:.

## 2025 Monkey Fists

Many of our friends have monkey fist heads on their fire poi. After working with kevlar rope for the Luminata Sun it felt like a fun adventure.

Z found some plastic (wow right?) cores online and we slowly tightned these up to shape.

<figure class="thin" markdown="span">

This shows the chain handles from our first poi. Ribbit and Z later braided kevlar handled for them.

## 2025 Flow Space

Many people have contributed to our shared haus' flow space. Kalesta found the haunted mirrors, Ribbit and Kalasta painted them matte black. Z designed custom prop holders. Dozen of props have found a home here.

![2024 Flow Area](https://static.cloudygo.com/static/Prop Making/2024%20Flow%20Area.jpg){: loading="lazy" }

At events we tend to have a similiar flow space where anyone can try different props, practice, or learn from us.

## 2024 Fire Puppet

[2024 Luminata Blog post](/2024-luminata/).
For Luminata, Kalesta and Ribbit choreographed a opening performance with a Sun fire puppet/prop.

## 2024 Palm Torches

Z and Ribbit constructed the first two sets for Kalesta. Later Z made a dozen blanks so any friends could also make a pair.

## 2024 Fire Horse

At several Fire jams all the fire props end up scattered about on the ground.
It's hard to find yours, your stepping on people's props, and it's easy to trip.

So Z created this "Fire [Saw] Horse" on a CNC.
It collapses and goes to all the fire events with us.
It holds around a half dozen staffs and poi at the same time.
V2 is constantly in the work but really is coming soon.

## 2023 Fire Cathedrals

Ribbit and Z made these as our first fire props in Oct 2023. One thing we learned was to put the washers one layer inside so you can touch your props more!

## 2023 POI

Ribbit made half a dozen sets of ribbon poi after 2023 May Day. Several are black and white with eyes for the Haus, Some are ribbon poi with reclaimed May Day ribbons. The green pair Z made and are EXTRA SUPER long.
