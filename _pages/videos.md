Anima's Studio
--------------

Lilac's music setup overflows. Our music tends to be created on keyboard and Maschine pad. Our more exotic sounds have featured nature samples (üê¶ü¶ö), modular synth, live mashup and hardware synth.

The house is often filled with piano melodies, drum loops, and electronic music.

In preparation for [ReIgnition](/events/reignition/) we're been working on a series of VCVRack Patches.

In *Rounds* the keyboard and knobs give control over key, tempo, reverb, and more.
