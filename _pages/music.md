## Space Sounds

Space Sounds is an interactive audio/visual exhibit created for Critical Northwest 2022. A collaboration between Zhigalka and Lilac, LED tubes have been programmed to interact with the midi signal generated by music being produced live. This allows us to synchonize the lights with the drums for example or allow a key press to change the pattern. In addition, Lilac created a custom interactive experience for participants to engage with the music being created.  By pressing the keys or twising the knobs participants can layer effects, speed or slow certain rythems, or change the timbre of some of the instruments.
