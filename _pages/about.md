We are the creators of the Anima Gallery/Club/Cafe.  We come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, but are united in our love of the sensory experience.

We include:

Zhigalko - A professional artist working largely on the visual side of our A/V art. They love to work in God's programming language, Python.

Lilac - A musician doing the audio side of our A/V art. They work with VCV Rack, Bitwig, and occasionally other tools to make noise.
